# Music Recommendation System
By analyzing audio features from the Spotify Million Song Dataset, the system computes the similarity between songs using cosine similarity, allowing users to discover new music that aligns with their tastes. 

## Overview

The **Music Recommendation System** utilizes the [Spotify Million Song Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset) from Kaggle to provide song recommendations. By implementing cosine similarity, users can search for songs and receive the top five similar results.
